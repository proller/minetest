minetest (0.4.8+repack2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #730554).
    - Upstream changes to their embeeded jthread library become
      intractable with our system-wide version. So switch to their
      version, even if it's a bad habit to embeed other libraries.
    - Refresh our patches (no big change beside of jthread).
  * Suggests the existing mod packages: moreblocks, moreores, pipeworks.
